# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) 1.1.0, and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

The customer-facing announcement for each release lives in [`docs/releases/`](docs/releases/) and is
written using this library's own `release-notes` template. This file is the record; that is the
announcement. The distinction is the one the `release-notes` bundle teaches: a changelog is for
people who want every change, release notes are for people who want to know what it means for them.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-17

First tagged release. Status `beta`: gate-green and cited to raw sources, with zero fills by anyone
but the author.

### Added

- Six governed bundles across two families, eight files each, `template_version` 0.1.0:
  - `delivery-docs`: `prd`, `user-stories`, `acceptance-criteria`, `release-notes`. Their worked
    examples chain across one feature, so the family reads as one traceable set.
  - `decision-docs`: `rfc` (propose a decision) and `adr` (record it, in MADR v4).
- `tools/check-bundles.py`, the governance gate: nine structural checks per bundle. Eight are pure
  standard library; check G (frontmatter YAML) uses PyYAML and skips honestly when it is absent
  (ADR 0014).
- `tools/check-links.py`, the link gate: every relative link and in-page anchor across every tracked
  Markdown file must resolve, and no tracked file may link into `_local/` (ADR 0013).
- `tools/known-skills.txt`, the pinned skill-ID list that `pairs_with` is validated against.
- CI on every push and pull request, with `main` branch-protected on the gate.
- `templates/methodology.md` (v0.2.3): the authoring process, the citation standard, and the
  per-bundle Definition of Done.
- `atlas/atlas.html`: a self-contained interactive map of all 205 catalog types.
- A six-step consumer quickstart in the README.
- Fourteen decision records at `docs/internal/decisions/` in MADR v4.
- Apache-2.0 license.

### Changed

- Citation standard hardened after a full integrity pass (methodology 0.2.3, section 6): one entry per
  source, honest retrieval status, blocked and paywalled sources labeled in the reference itself, and
  print books labeled as such rather than hidden inside a combined entry carrying a sibling's URL.
- Gate widened from seven checks to nine: citations are now verified in both directions, heading
  nesting compares depth as well as text, the meta is scanned for unfilled placeholders, the history
  must document the version the meta claims, and `pairs_with` / `related_templates` must resolve.
- README claims reconciled against what is true (see Fixed).

### Fixed

- 28 citation defects across the four `delivery-docs` bundles, every one of which had been passing the
  gate green. Included two wrong dates (Gherkin as 2007 rather than 2008; a 2006 Cagan essay dated
  2007), two quotations from sources that could not be read (one paywalled, one unreachable), claims
  attributed to authors who do not make them, and uncited padding.
- README overclaims: deterministic agent selection (no such path exists), a family described as
  "complete" and "verified", a stale four-bundle list, and a `docs/decisions/` path that does not
  exist and is forbidden by the org's scaffolder.
- `tools/check-links.py` did not skip fenced code blocks, so a documented Markdown-link example was
  read as a real link.

### Known gaps

Named here because the release is `beta` and the gaps are the reason:

- **No machine-consumption path.** No metadata schema, so an agent cannot select a bundle
  deterministically.
- **Not installable or listable.** `npx skills add` clones this repo and installs nothing, and
  agentskills.io has no template resource type: both take exactly one unit, the skill, and this repo
  ships no `SKILL.md` (decisions D2 and D3, resolved 2026-07-17).
- **No efficacy evals.** Template quality is argued, not measured.
- **No real usage cycle.** Every filled artifact in the repo is an authored example.
- **The gate cannot check citation truth.** It proves a citation resolves, never that the source
  supports the claim. The 28 defects above were all invisible to it.
